_"PHP is one of the best web programming 
languages in the world, and all 
the big important websites, like Google, Apple, Facebook, Yahoo, 
Wikipedia and many more, use it for their 
web applications."_

_"In this course we will level up your basic 
PHP, using it to build the 
back end and front end for a photo storage 
system."_

## Dev log
* It is a satisfying housecleaning, feeling 
all of my usual functions being vacuumed up 
into the three objects of this project.
* I see that it can become an obsession.  
Once you see the beauty of putting all your 
dirty laundry into a hamper, you also want 
to take existing library functions and 
redefine them (or bind them, I guess) as 
private methods inside the object.
* The obsession with semicolons is making me 
do things like end Git Commit Messages with 
a semicolon accidentally.  
* Open sublime in four pane grid. Use search 
to search from the root of the project.

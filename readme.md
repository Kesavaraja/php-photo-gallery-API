# PHP Project, with the help of Udemy *PHP OOP: Object Oriented 
Programming for beginners + Project*
## My goal
I need to finish four sections a day if I am to be done by Tuesday 
morning.  Bonus: if I am at all early I can take a look at PHPUnit, the 
testing method.

## From the Edwin Diaz course description at Udemy
PHP is one of the best web programming languages in the world, and all 
the big important websites, like Google, Apple, Facebook, Yahoo, 
Wikipedia and many more, use it for their web applications.

In this course we will level up your basic PHP, using it to build the 
back end and front end for a photo storage system.
